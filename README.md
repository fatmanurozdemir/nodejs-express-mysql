# Node.js Express MySQL Application on Kubernetes

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a web application using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MySQL** on a Kubernetes cluster. The goal is to create a robust **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipeline for an application that runs on top of a Kubernetes cluster, with database integration managed during the deployment. The web application, sourced from a public GitHub repository, is containerized using Docker, and Helm is utilized as the Kubernetes package manager for streamlined deployments. For this project, we use **kubeadm** to set up and manage the Kubernetes cluster.
